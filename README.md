    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m <a href="https://github.com/nav797" target="_blank">@nav797</a>!</h1>
    
  <p>Just a little about me:</p>
    
  <ul>
        <li>ðŸ‘€ <strong>Interests</strong>: Iâ€™m really into web development! I love creating cool websites and seeing how everything comes together. It's like putting together a puzzle, and Iâ€™m all about it.</li>
        <li>ðŸŒ± <strong>Learning Journey</strong>: Right now, Iâ€™m diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m enjoying the process of learningâ€”every day. Thereâ€™s definitely a lot to take in, but I'm having fun with it!</li>
        <li>ðŸŒŸ <strong>Aspiring Web Developer</strong>: I just kicked off my journey to become a web developer. Iâ€™m excited to build my skills and create a portfolio of projects. Each little project is like a stepping stone, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Future Goals</strong>: Iâ€™m hoping to get into both front-end and back-end development eventually. I want to learn how to make sites that are not just pretty but also super user-friendly.</li>
    </ul>
